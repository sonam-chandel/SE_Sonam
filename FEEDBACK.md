Sonam, your introduction is really good! 
It's clear and easy to understand. You started with your name and where you're from, which is great. You also shared your college and branch properly. Mentioning your hobbies like dancing and playing kabaddi gives a nice personal touch.
I especially liked how you ended with your interest in technology and real-world projects. It shows your passion and dedication. Overall, it’s a very balanced and confident introduction. Well done!
